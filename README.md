CRI is a simple interface designed for ChromeBooks to allow the user to download and run programs from the linux archives, that means you're no longer restricted to downloading web based applications from the Chrome Web Store! This is a still-in-the-works project that has only ever been tested on Toshiba model ChromeBooks but whould run fine on all Google ChromeBooks.
